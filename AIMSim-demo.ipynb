This package has a large number of dependencies with only a handful of versions supported, so conflicts are likely unless a virtual environment is used.\n",

    "For new Python users, the authors recommended installing anaconda navigator to manage dependencies for _AIMSim_ and make installation easier overall. Once anaconda navigator is ready, create a new environment with Python 3.8 or newer, open a terminal or command prompt in this environment, and follow the instructions below. \n",

The GUI works by serving the user with drop downs and text fields which represent settings that would otherwise need to be configured in a file by hand. This file is written to the disk by the GUI as part of execution so that the file can be used as a 'starting point' for more advanced use cases.\n",

In order to actually run the _AIMSim_ GUI alongside this tutorial, you will need to download this notebook and run it from a local installation of Jupyter, or follow the installation instructions above and start _AIMSim_ from there. You can install Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",

This configuration file can also access additional functionality present in _AIMSim_ which is not included in the GUI, such as the sampling ratio for the data (covered in greater depth in the __Command Line and Configuration Files__ section below).

The results from this approach are _non-deterministic_ because of the underlying algorithm driving the Isolation Forest, so this feature is intended to be a \"sanity check\" rather than a quantitative measure of 'outlier-ness'. To truly determine how different a single example molecule is to a set of molecules, use the `Compare Target Molecule` functionality discussed above.\n",

Can also point to a directory containing a group of PDB files, but the file path must end with a '/' (or '\\' for Windows).\n",

There are two general approaches to doing this, and the approach used depends on what other code you already have in place:\n",
